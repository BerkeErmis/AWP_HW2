# Advanced Web Programming Homework2

This project is a Laravel-based web application developed for the Advanced Web Programming course. It demonstrates database backup, XML parsing and display, as well as secure file upload and encryption functionalities.

## Project Overview

The project consists of three main tasks:

---

## Task 1: Database Backup and ZIP

- **Description:**  
  A custom Artisan command that backs up the entire SQLite database, exports all tables and their data as SQL `INSERT` statements into a `.txt` file, and then compresses this file into a ZIP archive.
- **How to Use:**  
  Run the following command in your terminal:
  ```bash
  php artisan app:backup-database database
  ```
  This will create backup files in `storage/app/` such as `backup_database_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt` and `backup_database_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip`.

## Task 2: XML Parsing and Profile Display

- **Description:**  
  Reads an XML file (`storage/app/LV2.xml`) containing 100 peopleâ€™s information (id, first name, last name, email, gender, picture, resume). The data is parsed and displayed as user profiles on a modern web page.
- **How to Use:**  
  Visit the following URL in your browser:
  ```
  http://localhost:8000/profiles
  ```
  You will see a list of all people with their picture, name, email, and resume.

## Task 3: Secure File Upload, Encryption, and Download

- **Description:**  
  Allows users to upload PDF, JPEG, or PNG files. Each uploaded file is encrypted using AES-256-CBC (via OpenSSL), and only the encrypted version is stored on the server. Users can view a list of encrypted files and download them; files are decrypted on-the-fly before download.
- **How to Use:**
  - **Upload a file:**  
    Go to `http://localhost:8000/encrypted/upload` and use the form to upload and encrypt a file.
  - **List and download files:**  
    Go to `http://localhost:8000/encrypted/list` to see all encrypted files. Click "Download and Decrypt" to download the original file.
